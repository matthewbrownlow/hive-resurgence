## Features

### Common Features

### Navigation Bar

- The navigation bar features a consistent design across all four pages keeping with convention with a logo on the left hand side and the navigation links to the right when the screen width is above 1200px wide to allow for easy of navigation.

- This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- The navigation bar sticks to the top of the web page regardless if you scroll down. This is achieved by using the `position: sticky;` declaration, accompanied by the `top: 0;` and `z-index: 1;` declarations to specify where to stick to, and to come on top over any `position: absolute;` items.

- The logo has a link to the home page `index.html` when clicked on to allow the user to navigate back to the home page no matter where they're at on the website.

- The navigation bar is fully responsive; for smaller screens (500px down), the format of the bar changes to a column orientation with the logo at the top centered on the page and the title links vertically aligned underneath. For tablets and screens in between (800px down), there is a staggered change through the use of media queries in order to maximise its size.

- All features of animation the navigation bar includes are highlighted `#daa520` text and an increase in text scale size (zoom) when you hovering over the navigation list items.

### Footer

- The footer features an array of socila network icons from awesome font; each icon has the same highlighted `#daa520` text animation as the navigation links, when you hover over them. The social network icons, when clicked, take you to the corresponding social platforms in a new tab.

- The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.
