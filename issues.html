                <br>
                <p>British bees have lost 97% of their flower-rich habitats in the past 60 years, caused by us.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As cities grow and agriculture becomes more intensive, bees are losing the wild spaces, hedgerows and meadows where they can find flowers and food.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Air pollution obscures the sweet smell of flowers, making it much harder for pollinators to find them. Research led by the University of Reading found that insects including bees, flies, moths and butterflies were being impaired by air pollution, reducing pollination rates by as much as 31%.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Honey bees are prone to a number of diseases which can range from minor inconveniences which may slightly reduce honey yield, to conditions that will rapidly kill colonies.</p>
                <p>American foulbrood (AFB) is an infectious brood disease caused by a spore-forming bacterium. It is the most widespread and destructive of the brood diseases, afflicting queen, drone, and worker larvae alike.</p>

                <h1>Toxic Pesticides</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Studies have shown that a group of pesticides damage the nervous systems and navigational abilities of bee, thiamethoxam (a type of neonicotinoid) being one of the most harmful pesticides. A single teaspoon of neonicotinoid is enough to deliver a lethal dose to 1.25 billion bees.</p>

            <h2>Did you know...</h2>
            <p>Social bees, such as honeybees and bumblebees, often live in hives or nests, above or below the ground, while most solitary bees nest in the ground.</p>

                <p>The hotter and wetter climate has and will continue to put bees under stress.</p>
                <p>Large bees, such as bumblebees, have lower heat tolerance, making them more susceptible to climate change and the warming climate. This decline in bees can cause “cascading” effects on plant pollination, affecting many ecosystems, including humans. Insects are the world's top pollinators.</p>

            <h2>Did you know...</h2>
            <p>If the queen bee dies in a honeybee hive the workers can create a new queen bee. They do this by selecting a young larva and by feeding it special food called 'royal jelly' the larva will develop into a fertile queen.</p>

                <br>
                <p>What would happen if bees went extinct? That's the big question.</p>
                <p>In time we would likely lose all the plants that bees usually naturally pollinate. All the wild animals that eat those plants would also struggle to find food. This plant based food shortage could continue along the food chain and eventually affect almost all living creatures on the planet including us human beings.</p>
